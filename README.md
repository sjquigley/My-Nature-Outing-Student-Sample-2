Nature studies offer Finnish students time to engage with nature and to learn about their own environmental impact. Finnish schools adopt a transdisciplinary approach to understanding environmental education, which contrasts with the U.S. approaches, where environmental education is almost solely taught during science courses and touched on only briefly through earth science standards. By un-disciplining environmental education, Finnish citizens have some of the most advanced content knowledge as it relates to climate change, and their policies, cultural practices, and aesthetics reflect that knowledge.

We've adapted the holistic, nature-centered methods we witnessed in the field to create My Nature Study and My Nature Outing, a coding template offering students an opportunity to work with tools to construct meaning in their world. Through this project of languaging and communicating their relationship with the natural environment, students will learn essential computer science concepts and learn to read/edit .html and .css documents.
 
### This template includes responsive design and cool tools like modal views. 

**-Commune with Nature**

**-Use Tools to construct meaning**

**-Scaffold Multimodal Learning**

**-Inform Environmental Policy**

## Get Started (Chromebook)

1.	Open your Chromebook and Sign into your Gmail Account.

2.	Go to GitHub.com, then search for/open My Nature Outing 

3.	Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP."
 
4.	Find and open the “my-nature-outing-main-zip” file in “Files/Downloads.”Then drag this folder into “MyFiles”  

5.	You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera.

6.	Next download [Code Pad Text Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-pad-text-editor/adaepfiocmagdimjecpifghcgfjlfmkh?hl=en-GB)

7.	Use the **Code Pad Text Editor** to open the style.css and index.html documents from your project folder.

8.	Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text!

9.	Once you have modified content and transferred your assets to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes."

10.	Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and change the setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save"

11.	This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

12.	Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
