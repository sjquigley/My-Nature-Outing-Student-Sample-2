 <!-- Welcome to My Nature Outing, where you'll use code to process and share your experiences with others. While you are making your visit to nature, gather pictures, sounds, and words you'll use in this document.

To get started making this document, you'll need to download the code from GitHub. If you want to easily publish your Nature Study on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, download code to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure folder where you'll be able to find them and organize assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. You'll also need a text editor like "brackets.io", "atom.io", or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own Nature Communication.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML code comments be, or delete them.-->

<!--First, we'll need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to explain to browsers how the website works. You can keep the title of this HTML document, "My Nature Outing," or change it to whatever you want to call it. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name to one word). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match your image asset. Next, change the other relevant information in this section."-->

   <!--We'll begin by thinking about the mode of seeing and the medium of photography. Seeing is just one way we come to understand our world. And when we use tools for seeing, like telescopes and microscopes, we can sometimes see an object differently from how we might otherwise. Sometimes we can bring the object closer, sometimes we can better frame the object, and sometimes we can bring different elements into focus. In this exercise we are going to think about how we can frame not the whole of the tree, but the branch, not the boulder, but the moss on its northern-most side. We might be in a big place, but we can use the lens to direct our attention to something smaller. So what are the parts that make up the whole of this system?-->

  <!--In this exercise we'll need to place our image assets in the project folder making sure each image is a .jpg or .png. Link the img src=to your image in your project folder. Then you'll need to scroll down to the corresponding modals at the bottom of this document to add the image there as well. The modal will pop-up when the audience activates the link. Finally, be sure to add an alt= description for visually impaired audiences-->

         <!--It's time to switch to a different mode, to that of listening. Let's think about sounds we might be able to capture in our nature study. This could be wind blowing, birds chirping, footsteps trudging, water rolling...what do you hear that you can share with your audience. Often audio gets recorded as .wav files and it's then converted into mp4s which are much smaller and lower quality, but easier to embed in websites. Place the files in the music folder and label them to match your code.-->

    <p>On the nature walk, we first went into the forest. There were lots of different animals including cicadas and chipmunks that lived in the lush beech trees that towered over us. We had to climb over decaying logs that had fungi growing on them. We then crossed a little creek that lead us to the majestic meadows that was blooming with flowers and little berries. The dirt path lead us back to the Frick Enviormental Center.</p>
